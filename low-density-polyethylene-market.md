<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Density Polyethylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Process</li><li>Tubular Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) is produced through two main processes: Autoclave Process and Tubular Process. Autoclave Process involves the use of high pressure and temperature in a reactor to polymerize ethylene gas into LDPE. On the other hand, Tubular Process uses a long tube reactor where ethylene is polymerized at lower pressure and temperature. Autoclave Process is used for producing LDPE with higher molecular weight and better melt strength, making it suitable for applications like films and coatings. Tubular Process, on the other hand, produces LDPE with lower molecular weight, ideal for products like packaging films and pipes.</p></p>
