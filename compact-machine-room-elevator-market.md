<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compact Machine Room Elevator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traction</li><li>Hydraulic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The compact machine room elevator market can be classified into two types: traction and hydraulic. Traction elevators utilize a system of ropes and counterweights to lift and lower the elevator car. This type is commonly used in high-rise buildings due to their efficient and fast operation. On the other hand, hydraulic elevators function by using a hydraulic pump to push the elevator car upwards. This type is often preferred for low-rise buildings as they are simpler in design and installation. Both types cater to the need for space-saving solutions in compact machine room setups.</p></p>
