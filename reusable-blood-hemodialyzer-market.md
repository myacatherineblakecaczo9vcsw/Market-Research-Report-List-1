<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reusable Blood Hemodialyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Pump</li><li>Double Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The reusable blood hemodialyzer market consists of two types: single pump and double pump. In a single pump system, there is one blood pump that circulates the patient's blood through the hemodialyzer and back into their body, removing waste products and excess fluid. On the other hand, a double pump system has two pumps - one for blood circulation and the other for dialysate flow. This enables better control over the dialysis process and allows customization to meet individual patients' needs. Both types serve the purpose of cleansing and purifying the blood during hemodialysis treatment.</p></p>
