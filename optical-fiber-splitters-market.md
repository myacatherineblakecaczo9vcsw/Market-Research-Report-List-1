<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Fiber Splitters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical fiber splitters can be classified into two main types - Type I and Type II. Type I splitters divide the incoming signal evenly into two output signals, making them ideal for applications requiring equal signal distribution. On the other hand, Type II splitters divide the incoming signal unevenly, with one output signal receiving more power than the other. This makes Type II splitters suitable for applications where a stronger signal is needed in one direction, such as in passive optical networks.</p></p>
