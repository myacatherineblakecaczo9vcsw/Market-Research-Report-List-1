<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon Dioxide Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotatable Transformation</li><li>Non Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silicon dioxide sputtering target market can be categorized into two types, namely rotatable transformation and non-rotating type. In rotatable transformation, the target can spin during the sputtering process, which enables uniform erosion and prolonged target life. It is suitable for applications with high deposition rates and high target utilization. On the other hand, the non-rotating type does not spin during sputtering and is advantageous for applications requiring high planarity and a smaller target size. Both types cater to different sputtering needs based on factors like deposition rate, target lifespan, and planarity requirements.</p></p>
