<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vitamin D Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>RIA</li><li>ELISA</li><li>CLIA</li><li>POCT</li><li>LC-MS/MS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vitamin D testing market comprises various types of diagnostic methods used to analyze vitamin D levels in the body. Radioimmunoassay (RIA), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA), Point-of-Care Testing (POCT), and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are the main methods utilized. RIA measures vitamin D levels via radioactive markers, while ELISA detects vitamin D antibodies. CLIA employs chemiluminescent reactions to determine vitamin D concentrations. POCT involves rapid on-site testing for immediate results. LC-MS/MS utilizes liquid chromatography to separate and mass spectrometry to detect vitamin D levels precisely. These methods aid in diagnosing vitamin D deficiencies and guiding appropriate treatments.</p></p>
