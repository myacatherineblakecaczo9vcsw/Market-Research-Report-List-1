<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suspension Bump Stopper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rubber Suspension Bump Stopper</li><li>Microcellular Polyurethane Elastomer (MPU) Suspension Bump Stopper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Suspension bump stoppers are used to prevent the suspension from bottoming out when a vehicle hits a bump or pothole. There are two main types of suspension bump stoppers - rubber and Microcellular Polyurethane Elastomer (MPU). Rubber bump stoppers are commonly used due to their flexibility and cost-effectiveness. MPU bump stoppers, on the other hand, offer improved durability and performance due to their higher resistance to compression set and tear strength. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring a smooth and controlled ride experience.</p></p>
