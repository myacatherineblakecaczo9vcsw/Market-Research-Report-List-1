<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helicopter Blades Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Main Rotor</li><li>Tail Rotor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The helicopter blades market consists of two main types: main rotor blades and tail rotor blades. Main rotor blades are larger in size and attach to the rotor mast at the top of the helicopter, providing lift and propulsion for the entire aircraft. Tail rotor blades are smaller and typically located at the tail end of the helicopter, counteracting the torque produced by the main rotor to stabilize the aircraft in flight. Both types of blades play crucial roles in the safe and efficient operation of a helicopter.</p></p>
