<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Cooling Battery Rack Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Air cCooling</li><li>Active Air Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive air cooling battery racks rely on natural airflow to dissipate heat generated by batteries, without the need for additional equipment or energy consumption. On the other hand, active air cooling battery racks use fans or other cooling systems to actively regulate the temperature of the batteries. While passive cooling is usually simpler and more cost-effective, active cooling can provide more precise temperature control and efficiency. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining the optimal operating temperature of batteries to ensure their longevity and performance.</p></p>
