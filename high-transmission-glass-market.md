<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Transmission Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plate Glass</li><li>Rolled Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High transmission glass is a type of glass that allows a high degree of light to pass through it. There are two main types of high transmission glass markets, plate glass and rolled glass. Plate glass is produced by pouring molten glass onto a large flat surface and then gravity pulling the glass into a uniform thickness. Rolled glass, on the other hand, is produced by pouring molten glass between two rollers to create a continuous sheet of glass. Both types of glass are used in various applications where maximum light transmission is desired.</p></p>
