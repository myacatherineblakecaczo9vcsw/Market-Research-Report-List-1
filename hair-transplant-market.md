<p><strong>The Hair Transplant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT)</li><li>Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hair transplant market consists of two primary types: Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE).
